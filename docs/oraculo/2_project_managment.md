# Project Model Canvas

## JUSTIFICATIONS
1. LEDS mentors have difficulty discovering the efficiency of students in completing tasks.  
2. Students lack a platform to check tasks and have them assigned.  
3. The repository analysis process is time-consuming when done manually.

---

## PRODUCT
A chatbot to assist in managing LEDS projects.

---

## SMART GOAL
Collect data from GitHub repositories and Discord conversations to create a chatbot that provides information about the progress of LEDS projects.

---

## REQUIREMENTS
- Friendly interface;  
- Extract data from GitHub repositories;  
- Extract information from Discord workgroup conversations;  
- Automate analysis of team and individual performance.

---

## BENEFITS 
- Display team performance in sprint progress;  
- Improve decision-making;  
- Check individual performance metrics.

---

## EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS & External Factors
Advisors, scholarship holders, staff, and other stakeholders involved in LEDS and FAPES.

---

## ASSUMPTIONS
- Team commitment.  
- Knowledge of the required technologies.

---

## RISKS

### 1. Requirement changes during the project  
- **Probability**: 20%  
- **Mitigation**: Ensure a solid requirements phase and allow flexibility in development to accommodate changes.

### 2. Lack of technical knowledge  
- **Probability**: 60%  
- **Mitigation**: Allocate time during sprints for learning and mastery.

### 3. Team member time constraints  
- **Probability**: 80%  
- **Mitigation**: Coordinate schedules and design viable sprints based on available time.

## TEAM

### Management:
- Ana Júlia Caetano (Dominance)  
- Caio Lessa  (Compliance)
- Davidson Santos (Steadiness)
- Thiago Borges (Compliance)

### Developers:
- Alicia Caporalli (Steadiness)  
- Lívia Hombre (Steadiness)
- Pedro Henrique Fonseca (Steadiness) 
- Thiago Fabiano (Dominance) 
- Vítor Nascimento (Compliance)

### Team Topology
- Plataform
  - Platform teams enable stream-aligned teams to deliver work with substantial autonomy.
    While the stream-aligned team maintains full ownership of building, running, and fixing an application in production, the platform team provides internal services that the stream-aligned team can use

## DELIVERABLES

### Management:
- **Sprint 1**: PMC and documentation  
- **Sprint 2**: Technology research and metric definition  
- **Sprints 3, 4, 5, 6**: Results with collected metrics  
- **Sprints 7 and 8**: Automated metrics and performance report

### Developers:
- **Sprint 1**: Architectural documentation  
- **Sprint 2**: Implementation of discussed technologies  
- **Sprints 3, 4, 5**: Code improvements and documentation  
- **Sprints 7 and 8**: Functional and documented application

---

## CONSTRAINTS
- The product must be developed using LangChain, DevLake, n8n, SonarQube, and OpenWebUI.  
- Dependency on AWS Marketplace/VSC environment.  
- Project deadline: 3 months.

## COSTS

- **Team time**: R$1,000.00 × 9 members = **R$9,000.00**  
- **Transportation (round trip for 3 months)**:  
  R$4.90 × 60 days × 9 members = **R$2,646.00**  
- **Food for team members**:  
  R$12.00 × 60 days × 9 members = **R$6,480.00**  
- **Mental health of team members**: **R$0.00**

**Total: R$18,126.00**
